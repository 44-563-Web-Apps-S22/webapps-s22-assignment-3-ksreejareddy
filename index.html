                  <h3>String Hashing</h3>
                  <blockquote>Hashing algorithms are helpful in solving a lot of problems.

                    We want to solve the problem of comparing strings efficiently. The brute force way of doing so is just to compare the letters of both strings, which has a time complexity of 
                     if 
                     and 
                     are the sizes of the two strings. We want to do better. The idea behind strings is the following: we convert each string into an integer and compare those instead of the strings. Comparing two strings is then an  operation.
                    
                    For the conversion, we need a so-called hash function. The goal of it is to convert a string into an integer, the so-called hash of the string. The following condition has to hold: if two strings  and  are equal (), then also their hashes have to be equal (). Otherwise, we will not be able to compare strings.</blockquote>
