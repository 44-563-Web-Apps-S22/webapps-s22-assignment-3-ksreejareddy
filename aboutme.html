     <p>The film's story begins with Shinnosuke and his friends of "Kasukabe Defence Force" experiencing a 
         one-week stay in "Tenkat≈çitsu Kasukabe Private Academy" (nicknamed "Tenkazu"), an elite boarding school 
         that is administrated by a state-of-the-art AI. In there someone attacks Kazama. 
         As a result, his intelligence is reduced, and strange bite marks are left on his butt.

         to form a group of detectives and solve the mystery.</p>
